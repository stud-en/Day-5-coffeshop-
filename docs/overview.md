# Simulated City (Workshop Template)

This template is for a workshop where students learn **agent-based programming in Python** by building pieces of a simple "simulated city"—a lightweight starting point for an **urban digital twin**.

The goal is to keep the code:

- Small enough to read in one sitting
- Modular enough to extend (agents, places, sensors, movement rules)
- Practical for notebook-driven exploration



## Repo overview

- `src/simulated_city/`: the library students import
- `notebooks/`: workshop notebooks
  - `01_maps_and_coordinates.ipynb` — Maps and coordinate system transforms
  - `02_mqtt_intro/` — MQTT publisher and subscriber examples with multi-broker support
- `docs/`: workshop handouts and exercises
- `tests/`: small sanity checks

## Library modules

- `simulated_city.config`: load settings from `config.yaml` + optional `.env`
- `simulated_city.mqtt`: build topics, connect, and publish MQTT messages
- `simulated_city.geo` (optional): CRS transforms for real-world coordinates
  - Enable with: `python -m pip install -e ".[geo]"`
  - Includes beginner-friendly helpers like `wgs2utm(...)` / `utm2wgs(...)`
