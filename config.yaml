# Default workshop configuration.
#
# For most workshops: keep this file committed, and put secrets in env vars.
# For other brokers: edit the mqtt.* fields (or create a separate config and load it).

mqtt:
  # Configure which brokers to use.
  # 
  # For multiple brokers (current):
  #   active_profiles: [local, mqtthq]
  # 
  # For a single broker only:
  #   active_profiles: [local]
  # 

  # The first profile in the list is the primary (default) broker.
  active_profiles: [local, hivemq_cloud]

  # Broker profiles.
  # Profile values override any common mqtt.* settings below.
  profiles:
    # Local broker (your Windows Mosquitto service)
    local:
      host: "127.0.0.1"
      port: 1883
      tls: false

    # Public broker example for the MQTT HQ app.
    # If you use a different host/port in MQTT HQ, set them here.
    mqtthq:
      host: "broker.mqttdashboard.com"
      port: 1883
      tls: false

    # Existing default (HiveMQ Cloud-style).
    # Replace host with your cluster host, e.g. "xxxxxx.s1.eu.hivemq.cloud".
    hivemq_cloud:
      host: "c451c402b7fb41b399936cd5727a1d3f.s1.eu.hivemq.cloud"
      port: 8883
      tls: true
      username_env: "HIVEMQ_USERNAME"
      password_env: "HIVEMQ_PASSWORD"

  # Optional alternative if you connect via WebSockets instead of raw MQTT.
  # websockets: false
  # websocket_path: "/mqtt"

  # Credentials (optional).
  # Tip: keep secrets in env vars, and set them per-profile above.

  # Client settings
  client_id_prefix: "simcity"
  keepalive_s: 60

  # Topic defaults (projects can change these)
  base_topic: "simulated-city"

# EXAMPLE: To use multiple MQTT brokers simultaneously, uncomment and edit above.
# Replace the single "profile: local" line with:
#
#   active_profiles: [local, mqtthq]
#
# Then in your code, access both brokers:
#   config = load_config()
#   # Primary (first) broker:
#   print(config.mqtt.host)
#   # All available brokers by name:
#   print(config.mqtt_configs["local"].host)
#   print(config.mqtt_configs["mqtthq"].host)
